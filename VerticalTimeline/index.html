          <h3>Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less</h3>

          <p>America, now is not the time for small plans. No matter where it takes hold, government of the people and by the people sets a single standard for all who hold power: you must maintain your power through consent, not coercion; you must respect
            the rights of minorities, and participate with a spirit of tolerance and compromise; you must place the interests of your people and the legitimate workings of the political process above your party. Likewise, it is important for Western countries
            to avoid impeding Muslim citizens from practicing religion as they see fit - for instance, by dictating what clothes a Muslim woman should wear.

          <h3>There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq</h3>

          <p>John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service because they've defined his life. Anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the Reagan Coalition. That is true genius of this nation.
